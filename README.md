- **Local Data Storage**: All data stored locally, no external transmission
- **Unique IDs**: UUID-based identification for all entities
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## üîß Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying variables in `main.py`:

- **Database Path**: Change `db_path` in `DatabaseManager`
- **Screenshot Directory**: Modify `screenshots_dir` in `ScreenshotService`
- **Server Settings**: Update host/port in `uvicorn.run()`

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Screenshot Permission Denied**
   - Grant screen recording permissions in system settings
   - On macOS: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Screen Recording

2. **Database Locked Error**
   - Ensure only one instance of the application is running
   - Check file permissions on the database file

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `main.py` or stop other services using port 8000

### Logs and Debugging

- Check console output for error messages
- Database errors are logged with full stack traces
- Screenshot failures are logged but don't stop the application

## üîó Insightful.io Integration

This application is designed to be compatible with Insightful.io's API structure:

- **Data Models**: Match Insightful.io user and time entry formats
- **Attendance Reports**: Generate reports in Insightful.io format
- **System Information**: Collect data similar to Insightful.io monitoring

For full integration with Insightful.io, you would need to:
1. Obtain API credentials from Insightful.io
2. Implement API client to sync data
3. Configure webhook endpoints for real-time updates
